Brief Speech for Terraform AWS Infrastructure Automation Presentation
Introduction to Terraform AWS Automation:
"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone! Today, I'll walk you through automating AWS infrastructure using Terraform. 
Terraform enables us to define infrastructure as code, ensuring consistency, scalability, and version control.
I'll explain how each component of the Terraform script contributes to building a robust infrastructure."

Backend Configuration:
"We begin with the backend configuration. Here, Terraform uses an S3 bucket to store the state file, which tracks resource metadata and configurations.
DynamoDB is configured for state locking, preventing simultaneous updates that could lead to inconsistencies. 
This setup ensures a secure and reliable backend for our infrastructure."

AMI Selection:
"For our EC2 instances, we use the aws_ami data source to select the most recent Ubuntu AMI from Canonical. 
This ensures that the instances are up-to-date with the latest features and security patches. 
Filters are applied for virtualization type and image name to refine the selection."

Networking - VPC and Subnets:
"Next, we define the network layer. A VPC is created with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16. 
We set up a public subnet for internet-facing resources and a private subnet for internal services. 
The public subnet is associated with a route table that directs traffic through an internet gateway, enabling external connectivity."

Security Groups:
"Security groups are essential for controlling traffic to and from our resources. 
In this setup, we allow SSH ingress on port 22 from any IP address for management purposes. 
Outbound traffic is unrestricted to ensure communication with other AWS services."

EC2 Instance:
"An EC2 instance is launched in the public subnet, using the Ubuntu AMI we selected earlier. 
The instance is attached to a security group and a root block device. 
Additionally, an external EBS volume is provisioned for extra storage and attached to the instance. 
User data is used to install necessary packages and configure the system during startup."

Logging and Artifact Storage:
"We integrate CloudWatch and S3 for monitoring and artifact storage. CloudWatch captures logs such as instance creation events, which are retained for 90 days. 
An S3 bucket is used to store artifacts, providing a centralized location for historical data and event tracking."

IAM Roles and Policies:
"IAM roles grant our EC2 instances access to CloudWatch and S3 without requiring hardcoded credentials. 
The role has a policy attached, allowing actions like writing logs to CloudWatch and uploading objects to S3. 
This ensures secure and principle-of-least-privilege access."

DynamoDB Table:
"We define a DynamoDB table named products for data storage. Attributes like id, barcode, and name are configured. 
A Global Secondary Index is added to support optimized queries. The table also serves as a state-locking mechanism for Terraform operations."

CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions:
"Finally, we automate deployment using a CI/CD pipeline. GitHub Actions runs Terraform commands like init, plan, and apply whenever code is pushed to the 
main branch. AWS credentials are securely configured, and infrastructure changes are applied automatically, streamlining the deployment process."

Conclusion:
"In summary, this Terraform script provides a comprehensive and automated approach to managing AWS infrastructure. From backend configuration to networking, 
security, and CI/CD integration, every step ensures efficiency, security, and scalability. Thank you, and Iâ€™m happy to answer any questions!"


I'll provide 5 specific examples of how the infrastructure components interact:

SSH Access and Network Connection

CopyExample: Developer connects to EC2 instance
- Internet Gateway allows external access
- Public Subnet hosts the EC2 instance
- Security Group permits SSH (port 22)
- User can remotely access the Ubuntu server

Logging Workflow

CopyExample: System generates application logs
- EC2 instance writes logs to CloudWatch
- IAM Role (CloudWatch/S3 Access) permits logging
- Logs stored in "/aws/ec2/audit_trail" log group
- Log retention set to 90 days

Artifact Storage Process

CopyExample: Deployment artifacts need preservation
- EC2 instance generates build artifacts
- IAM Role provides S3 write permissions
- Artifacts written to "artifact-history-bucket"
- Random suffix ensures unique bucket name

DynamoDB Product Management

CopyExample: E-commerce product catalog management
- EC2 instance has full DynamoDB access
- Products table with composite key (id + barcode)
- Global secondary index on product name/description
- Supports complex product lookup strategies

Volume Management

CopyExample: Additional storage requirements
- External EBS volume attached to EC2
- Volume size dynamically calculated
- Mounted as "/dev/xvdh"
- Allows flexible storage expansion
